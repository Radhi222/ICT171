            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                Pearl Threading is a beauty and self-care platform centered around professional threading and natural beauty treatments.
                Designed as a modern beauty service business, it offers a clean, comfortable environment where clients can receive expert threading, waxing, tinting, and henna treatments.
                The goal is to enhance personal confidence and self-expression through skilled, affordable, and culturally inspired beauty services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core focus of Pearl Threading is the art of threadingâ€”an ancient, chemical-free technique of facial hair removal known for its precision, gentleness on skin, and ability to create clean, defined eyebrow shapes.
                This traditional method is complemented by additional services, including waxing, tinting, and henna designs, to provide a holistic approach to facial and skin grooming.
            </p>
            <p>
                To support the operations and growth of the business, Pearl Threading will use cloud-based infrastructure hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
                The service will run on a Linux-based virtual machine using AWS EC2, providing a secure, scalable, and globally accessible platform.
                This cloud setup will support appointment scheduling, client management, and service promotion via an integrated content management system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rich media such as high-resolution photos and promotional videos will be stored and delivered using Amazon S3 for high availability and fast load times.
                AWS Route 53 will manage the domain and DNS services, while AWS Certificate Manager will ensure secure HTTPS connections for all online interactions.
            </p>
