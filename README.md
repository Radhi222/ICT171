## üîß EC2 Server Setup

To host the Pearl Threading website, I launched a virtual server using **Amazon EC2** (Ubuntu 22.04). The steps are listed below:

1. **Logged in** to AWS Management Console.
2. Navigated to **EC2 > Launch Instance**.
3. Selected:
   - **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS**
   - **t2.micro** (eligible for free tier)
4. Created a **new key pair** (e.g., `ict171keypair1-key.pem`) for SSH access.
5. Configured **Security Group rules**:
   - ‚úÖ TCP 22 ‚Äì SSH (My IP)
   - ‚úÖ TCP 80 ‚Äì HTTP (Anywhere)
6. Launched the instance and connected using this command:  
```bash
ssh -i "ict171keypair1-key.pem" ubuntu@18.214.189.146 ````


## üåê Installing Apache Web Server

After connecting to my EC2 instance using SSH, I installed **Apache2**, the open-source web server software.

1. **Updated package lists:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
